# 2048-Spinoff
A spinoff of the popular game 2048 for an AP CS Final project.

Combining numbers can feel like math, so why not combine colors instead? This game displays graphics but is played through the console. 
The rules are like 2048. Use the 'wasd' keys to shift the blocks in the corresponding direction. Combine like colors to get a new color.
See what colors you can unlock!

Written in Java, I used Eclipse IDE to run this code.
